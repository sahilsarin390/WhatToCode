Hello Guys!
So you just visited my first ever webpage.
So i designed this using HTML,CSS and JavaScript which i learnt completely from scratch on Progate.com.
Progate is a brilliant site for those who really want to learn something.

So the idea behind this webpage is that i have compiled a list of all the most trending Programming languages at this age. And on just one click you can learn absolutely everything about that chosen language.
I hope this webpage really helped you. 
I tried to keep things as simple and minimalistic as possible.
Hope This Helped!!
Thanks Alot!!!!
